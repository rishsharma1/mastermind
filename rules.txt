Welcome to Mastermind.
I will construct a 4 letter codeword from these letters {A,B,C,D,E,F}
and it will be your job to guess my codeword.

Rule 1: Your guess must be 4 characters long.
Rule 2: Your guess must contain all uppercase characters.
Rule 3: Each character in your guess must be in {A,B,C,D,E,F}.
Rule 4: You must guess within 10 tries or less.

Each time you make a valid guess, I will give you a hint.
The hint will be in the format of [b:m]

b = number of characters in your guess that are in the correct position
m = number of characters that are within the codeword but not in the
right positions in your guess.
					  
Good Luck!
